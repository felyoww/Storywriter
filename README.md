# Story Writer Application

For the ETS Mobile Programming course, I created a simple application called "Story Writer". Inspired by an application that I often use, this application has the benefit of being a container for ideas or a story writer whose results will be stored in a database. For the database itself, in this project I use the sqflite database.

## Getting Started
